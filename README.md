# Alibaba Cloud ROS examples

Alibaba Cloud Resource Orchestration Service (ROS) template examples in YAML. Templates allow you to define stacks with
resources that you can manage as a whole and upgrade atomically. By practicing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) you create
reproducible environments in the cloud that help you spin up the resources you need declaratively, without any
management console clicky-clicky.

Officially, Alibaba Cloud ROS only supports JSON template, but you can use our [unofficial CLI tool](https://github.com/leonrodenburg/ali-cli)
to deploy YAML templates as well.
